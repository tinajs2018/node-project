<h1>It call for real power to look at the mirrow and recognize you are not prefect </h1>
<img src="/img6.jpg" alt="">

<p>Looking at the mirrow i like the girl is see not because of her beauty but her courage her dreams 
    and the power of divine wisdom .She work too hard to a better two second from now .She is not prefect 
    she has countless flaws but she keep on moving because that what she is good and .She believe that life and to be lived to 
    fullest and that what she is doing all the way.
</p>
<p>
    That women in that mirrow is my motivation each day i loook at her i i remember what i want in this good life
    God gave us to live.To live is my God love and mercy since he keeps us alive  but to make  something
    out of your life is up to you and then God to help you .Make the best decision each second because we are just
    piles of our decision

    <h1>How have we come this far</h1>
    <p>Along the way their we so many setback then we never that .But each challange has been a learning curce
        along the way.The lessons learnt are lifetime and are invaliable.One of the most important indivudual i told
        me this once the only thing on earth you dont fet for freeis the experience .And today around 10 years down
        the line i prove it is the truth.
